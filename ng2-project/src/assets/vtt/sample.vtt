NOTE Paragraph

00:00:00.673 --> 00:00:02.493
Ever order take out but was too busy

00:00:02.493 --> 00:00:03.783
to go pick it up yourself?

00:00:03.783 --> 00:00:05.323
Well we got what you need!

00:00:05.373 --> 00:00:07.583
Foodar is a delivery tracking system

00:00:07.583 --> 00:00:09.203
where foodies will order take-out

00:00:09.203 --> 00:00:11.273
from local restaurants and then use it to

00:00:11.273 --> 00:00:13.463
find a driver to pick up 
and deliver to them.

00:00:13.463 --> 00:00:15.603
Delivery fees will be calculated based on

00:00:15.603 --> 00:00:17.683
distance driven plus a base fee.

00:00:17.683 --> 00:00:20.253
Users must register a card to auto-pay

00:00:20.253 --> 00:00:22.233
drivers the approved amount.

00:00:22.508 --> 00:00:24.478
At this level, you will 
be building the

00:00:24.478 --> 00:00:26.388
basic layout and pages for the website.

00:00:26.388 --> 00:00:28.318
You will also add functionality for a

00:00:28.318 --> 00:00:29.548
basic coordinate system.

00:00:29.548 --> 00:00:30.958
The courses we will cover are

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:32.998
the fundamental languages of the internet.

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:35.398
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

00:00:35.398 --> 00:00:36.798
You will find that together

00:00:36.798 --> 00:00:39.528
these three languages form the 
core background of what is

00:00:39.528 --> 00:00:40.948
presented on your browser.

00:00:40.948 --> 00:00:42.678
You will gain a greater understanding

00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:44.628
of each and be able to utilize

00:00:44.628 --> 00:00:46.218
each to build your own website.

00:00:46.218 --> 00:00:48.168
In this level 100 internship we will

00:00:48.168 --> 00:00:50.128
provide you with wireframe documents that

00:00:50.128 --> 00:00:52.018
will serve as a template for you to build

00:00:52.018 --> 00:00:54.018
the basic layout of your pages. We will

00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:56.088
also provide documentation such as UML

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:58.418
diagrams describing the functionality

00:00:58.418 --> 00:01:00.458
that you will develop. 
It is your job to

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:02.668
update these documents or artifacts,

00:01:02.668 --> 00:01:05.168
code your vision for Foodar and test the

00:01:05.168 --> 00:01:06.628
new functionality.

00:01:06.628 --> 00:01:08.568
Upon finishing this internship, you will

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:10.658
unlock the next level of projects and

00:01:10.658 --> 00:01:12.238
courses. This is a core project

00:01:12.238 --> 00:01:14.098
to complete in becoming a web developer

00:01:14.098 --> 00:01:15.108
and front-end expert.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:16.258
Foodar will unlock other

00:01:16.258 --> 00:01:18.136
frameworks such as jQuery and Angular.

00:01:18.136 --> 00:01:19.866
So if you like food, then this is the app

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:21.366
for you!
Let's get moving!
